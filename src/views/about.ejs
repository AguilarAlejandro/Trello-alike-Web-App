                    <p>Venom Snake is the leader of a mercenary unit who returns to the battlefield
                        after waking up from a nine-year coma in an incident that also resulted in the loss of his left
                        arm and a piece of shrapnel embedded into the right side of his forehead. While initially
                        introduced in-game as long-standing Metal Gear character Big Boss, hints of his true identity
                        gradually emerge throughout the course of the story. It is ultimately revealed that he is
                        actually a former combat medic who underwent facial reconstruction and subliminal brainwashing
                        to serve as Big Boss' body double; via retcon, Venom Snake is also revealed to be the man killed
                        by Solid Snake at the end of the original 1987 game. Venom Snake's design and role in The
                        Phantom Pain received mixed opinions from critics.
